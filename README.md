# Creation-and-assingment-of-pointers

This program is an **introduction to pointers**. In this program, we assign pointer p1 to memory address of a variable a (a = 10).

Then, the program shows in the screen of the user:
* the memory address of the variable a
* the value of the variable a
* the value of the pointer p1
* the value pointed by the pointer p1
* the memory address of the pointer p1
