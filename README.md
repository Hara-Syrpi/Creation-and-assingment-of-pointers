# Creation-and-assingment-of-pointers

This program is an introduction to pointers. In this program, we assign pointer p1 to memory address of a variable a (a = 10).
Then, the program shows in the screen of the user: a. the memory address of the variable a
                                                   b. the value of the variable a
                                                   c. the value of the pointer p1
                                                   d. the value pointed by the pointer p1
                                                   e. the memory address of the pointer p1
